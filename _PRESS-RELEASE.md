There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##

  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Battlecode

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  
  For all experienced programmers, can you think faster than your opponent?

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  This product is a new game which takes competitive programming to a whole new level. Most programmers hone their skills
  by continually practicing programming exercises or 'toy problems' on their own time. However, the lack of pressure and
  endless amount of free time doing this can cause some people to lose interest. So why not make it a bit more intense and
  a bit more fun by adding a competitor in the mix? Compete against your friends and see who can come up with the best solution
  to a given programming prompt in the quickest amount of time, and in the most efficient time possible.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  The main obstacle that this game attempts to solve is the boredom that can come from endlessly trying to solve 'toy problems'
  on your own time. Most programmers know that, in order to sharpen their skills, they need to continually broaden their experience
  with programming problems in order to develop their problem-solving intution. However, continually clicking the next button
  after solving one prompt after another can get boring after awhile and people can start to lose interest in the routine nature
  of the task.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  
  This new game makes solving toy problems more exciting by throwing in a time constraint and competitive edge
  to the mix. Not to mention that it can be rewarding to see how other people solve a given programming challenge using a different
  approach than you might

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "I've always enjoyed doing toy problems on my own time, visiting sites like codewars and leetcode for practice. However, this
  environment is entirely different as coding against another person infuses the experience with a level of excitement that
  comes from introducing a friendly competitive element into the mix"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Simply signup for an account by registering with a new username and password. Then enter the Battlecode arena and play against
  anyone else looking for challenge.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "Lots of fun and very addicting! I'm constantly playing other users on battlecode and I can't stop playing it!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
